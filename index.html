      DIDs that target a distributed ledger face significant practical
      challenges in bootstrapping enough meaningful trusted data around
      identities to incentivize mass adoption.
      We propose a new DID method using a web domain's existing reputation.

      Web DID Method Specification

    <section>
      <h2>
        Target system
      </h2>
      <p>
        The target system of the Web DID method is the host (or domain if the
        host
        is not specified) name when the domain specified by the DID is resolved
        through the Domain Name System (DNS).
      </p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
        Method name
      </h2>
      <p>
        The namestring that shall identify this DID method is: <code>web</code>.

        A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix:
        <code>did:web</code>. Per the DID specification, this string MUST be in
        lowercase. The remainder of the DID, after the prefix, is specified
        below.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
        Method-specific identifier
      </h2>
      <p>
        The method specific identifier is a fully qualified domain name that is
        secured by a TLS/SSL certificate with an optional path to the DID
        document. The formal rules describing valid domain name syntax are
        described in [[RFC1035]], [[RFC1123]], and [[RFC2181]].
      </p>
      <p>
        The method specific identifier MUST match the common name used in the
        SSL/TLS certificate, and it MUST NOT include IP addresses. A port MAY be
        included and the colon MUST be percent encoded to prevent a conflict
        with paths. Directories and subdirectories MAY optionally be included,
        delimited by colons rather than slashes.

      <h2>
        Key Material and Document Handling
      </h2>
      <p>
        Due to the way most web servers present content, it is likely that a
        particular `did:web` document will be served with a media type of
      `application/json`. If a document is retrieved and it is named
      `did.json`, a few processing rules should apply:
      <ul>
        <li>
          If an
          `@context` is present at the root of the JSON document,
          the document should be processed according to the JSON-LD rules.
          If this is not possible, or if the document fails processing, the
          document should be rejected from consideration as a `did:web` doc.
        </li>
        <li>
          If an
          `@context` is present at the root of the JSON document,
          and it passes JSON-LD processing, and it contains the context
          `https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1`, it may be further processed
          as a
          DID document as specified by section
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#consumption-0">6.3.2</a> of
          the
          [[did-core]] specification.
        </li>
        <li>
          If no
          `@context` is present, it should be processed via normal
          JSON rules for DID processing as specified in section
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#consumption">6.2.2</a> of the
          [[did-core]] specification.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever a DID URL is present within a `did:web` document, it must
        be an absolute URL.
      <p class="note">
        This includes URLs inside of embedded key material and other metadata, and
        prevents
        key confusion attacks.

      <h2>
        DID method operations
      </h2>
      <section>
        <p>
          There is intentionally no HTTP API specified for did:web method
          operations leaving programmatic registrations and management to be
          defined by each implementation, or based on their own requirements in
          their web environment.
        </p>
        </p>
        <h3>
          Create (Register)
        </h3>
        <p>
          Creating a DID is done by:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            applying at a domain name registrar for use of a domain name and
          </li>
          <li>
            storing the location of a hosting service, the IP address at a DNS
            lookup service
          </li>
          <li>
            creating the DID document JSON-LD file including a suitable keypair,
            e.g. using the Koblitz Curve, and storing the <code>did.json</code>
            file under the well-known URL to represent the entire domain, or
            under the specified path if many DIDs will be resolved in this
            domain.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          For example, for the domain name `w3c-ccg.github.io`, the `did.json`
          will be available under the following URL:
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Creating the DID">
did:web:w3c-ccg.github.io
 -> https://w3c-ccg.github.io/.well-known/did.json
          </pre>

        <p>
          If an optional path is specified rather the bare domain, the
          <code>did.json</code> will be available under the specified path:
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"
          title="Creating the DID with optional path">
did:web:w3c-ccg.github.io:user:alice
 -> https://w3c-ccg.github.io/user/alice/did.json
          </pre>

        <p>
          If an optional port is specified on the domain, the port colon
          splitting the host and the port MUST be percent encoded to prevent
          collision with the path.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"
          title="Creating the DID with optional path and port">
did:web:example.com%3A3000:user:alice
 -> https://example.com:3000/user/alice/did.json

        <h3>
          Read (Resolve)
        </h3>
        <p>
          The following steps MUST be executed to resolve the DID document from
          a Web DID:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Replace ":" with "/" in the method specific identifier to obtain the
            fully qualified domain name and optional path.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the domain contains a port percent decode the colon.
          </li>
          <li>
            Generate an HTTPS URL to the expected location of the DID document
            by prepending <code>https://</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If no path has been specified in the URL, append
            <code>/.well-known</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Append <code>/did.json</code> to complete the URL.
          </li>
          <li>
            Perform an HTTP <code>GET</code> request to the URL using an agent
            that can successfully negotiate a secure HTTPS connection, which
            enforces the security requirements as described in <a
              href="#security-and-privacy-considerations"></a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Verify that the ID of the resolved DID document matches the Web DID being resolved.
          </li>
          <li>
            When performing the DNS resolution during the HTTP <code>GET</code>
            request, the client SHOULD utilize [[RFC8484]] in order to prevent
            tracking of the identity being resolved.
          </li>
        </ol>

          To update the DID document, the <code>did.json</code> has to be
          updated. Please note that the DID will remain the same, but the
          contents of the DID document could change, e.g., by including a new
          verification key or adding service endpoints.

          DNS Considerations
        </h3>
        <h4>
          DNS Security Considerations
        </h4>
        <p>
          DNS presents many of the attack vectors that enable active security
          and privacy attacks on the did:web method and it's important that
          implementors address these concerns via proper configuration of DNS.
          For example, without proper security of the DNS resolution via <a
            href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484">DNS over HTTPS</a> it's
          possible for active attackers to intercept the result of the DNS
          resolution via a Man in the Middle attack which would point at a
          malicious server with the incorrect DID Document.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, implementors should be aware of issues presented by a
          Spoofed DNS records where the record returned by a malicious DNS
          Server is inauthentic and allows the record to be pointed at a
          malicious server which contains a different DID Document. To prevent
          this type of issue, usage of DNSSEC which is
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4033">RFC4033</a>,
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4034">RFC4034</a>, and
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4035">RFC4035</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>
          DNS Privacy Considerations
        </h4>
        <p>
          Due to the nature of the did:web method relying upon a DNS in order to
          resolve the web server, all resolutions of a did:web identifier have
          the potential to be tracked by a DNS provider. Additionally, due to
          the DID Document being stored on a web server, each time the DID
          Document resource is retrieved, the web server has the ability to
          track the resolution of the DID Document. To mitigate the issue of the
          relying party being tracked when resolving the DID Document the
          relying party should look to either use a trusted universal resolver
          service to gain herd privacy, utilize a VPN service or perform a
          resolution over the TOR network. Another emerging solution that will
          be useful to address this is <a

        <p>
          Additional mechanisms such as <a
            href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sporny-hashlink">Hashlinks</a>
          MAY be utilized to aid in integrity protection and verification of the
          DID document.
          <br />
          Under such a scenario the hash of the DID document could be recorded
          to a trusted or distributed store and the retriever of the DID
          document would generate a hash of the DID document in their posession
          with the hash retrieved to ensure that no tampering with the DID
          document had occurred.

          Guidance from <a
            href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-52/rev-2/final">
            NIST SP 800-52 Rev. 2
          </a> or superceding, MUST be followed for delivery of a `did:web`
          document.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is additionally recommended to adhere to the latest recommendations
          from OWASP's Transport Layer Protection Cheat Sheet [[OWASP-TRANSPORT]]
          for hardening TLS configurations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consult <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-57-part-1/rev-5/final">
            NIST SP 800-57
          </a> for guidance on cryptoperiod, which is the time span during which
          a specific key is authorized for use or in which the keys for a given
          system or application may remain in effect.
        </p>

        <p>
          TLS configuration MUST use at least SHA256, and SHOULD use SHA384,
          POLY1305, or stronger, depending on the needs of your
          operating environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Delete action MAY be performed by domain name registrars or DNS lookup
          services.
        </p>

        <p>
          As of this writing, TLS 1.2 or higher SHOULD be configured to use
          only strong ciphers suites and to use sufficiently large key sizes.
          As recommendations may be volatile these days, only the very latest
          recommendations should be used. However, as a rule of thumb,
          the following set of suites is a reasonable starting point:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            ECDHE with one of the strong curves {X25519, brainpoolP384r1, NIST
            P-384, brainpoolP256r1, NIST P-256} shall be used as key exchange.
          </li>
          <li>
            AESGCM or ChaCha20 with 256 bit large keys shall be used for bulk
            encryption
          </li>
          <li>
            ECDSA with one of the strong curves {brainpoolP384r1, NIST P-384,
            brainpoolP256r1, NIST P-256} or RSA (at least 3072) shall be used.
          </li>
          <li>
            Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) shall be used
            as Mac.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Examples of strong SSL/TLS configurations for now are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, TLSv1.2, Kx=ECDH, Au=ECDSA, Enc=AESGCM(256), Mac=AEAD</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, TLSv1.2, Kx=ECDH, Au=RSA Enc=AESGCM(256), Mac=AEAD</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305, TLSv1.2, Kx=ECDH, Au=ECDSA, Enc=ChaCha20-Poly1305, Mac=AEAD</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305, TLSv1.2, Kx=ECDH, Au=RSA, Enc=ChaCha20-Poly1305, Mac=AEAD</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, TLSv1.2, Kx=ECDH, Au=RSA, Enc=AESGCM(256), Mac=AEAD</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, TLSv1.2, Kx=ECDH, Au=ECDSA, Enc=AESGCM(256), Mac=AEAD</code>

        <h3>
          Optional Path Considerations
        </h3>
        <p>
          When optional paths to DID documents are used to resolve documents
          rather than bare domains, verification with signed data proves that
          the entity in control of the file indicated in the path has the
          private keys. It does not prove that the domain operator has the
          private keys.
        </p>

        <p>
          This example:
        </p>

        <pre class="nohighlight">
did:web:example.com:u:bob
          </pre>
        <p>
          resolves to the DID document at:
        </p>
        <pre class="nohighlight">
https://example.com/u/bob/did.json
        </pre>
        <p>
          In this scenario, it is probable that example.com has given user Bob
          control over the DID in question, and proofs of control refer to Bob
          rather than all of example.com.

          Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Policy Considerations

        <p>
          To support scenarios where DID resolution is performed by client
          applications running in a web browser, the file served for the DID
          document should be accessible by any origin. To enable this,
          the DID document HTTP response can be set to include the
          following header:
